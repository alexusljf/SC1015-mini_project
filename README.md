# Problem Definition
  * Predict the optimal price of COE 
  * Making profit using the COE market

# Models Used
  1. Linear Regression

# Conclusion
 1. Timing to buy COE.
    From our data, we can see that there is a 10 year gap between car de-registration. 
    You should target for that downtrend and then you should be able to buy it at a cheaper price.

 2. COE price is determined by the amount of quota.
    The government will always release the number of quota before the price.
    Therefore, if you were to see a very high amount of quota announced, the quota premium price has a high chance to be lower.

# Future Plans
 * Our future plan is to continue researching on different types of trading algorithms and strategies that could help maximise the profit our project can make.

# What did we learn from this project?
From this project, we have learnt
 * Data cleaning techniques
 * Epoch Timing
 * Data Visualization
 * Linear Regression
 * Some stock market prediction algorithms
